<p>Open Data Nepal is an initiative to facilitate Open Data movement in Nepal. It is not about creating yet another data repository in the web but an effort to curate and disseminate data that is already available in public domain by some means in a more organized and usable manner following open data standards and principles. Rather than making data that is meant for public consumption to reside in hard copy formats or in formats that is not easy to analyze and process, we want them to be released as open data so as that they make more sense. Open Data Nepal in this regard aims at provide a platform for government agencies, civil society organizations, donor communities and even corporate sectors to publish data in open standards. </p>
