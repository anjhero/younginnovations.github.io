<div class="layout work-description">
<p>Program for Social Accountability in Nepal (PRAN) with support from World Bank

organized a platform for civil society organizations, development partners and major 

stakeholders to come together and discuss their role in promoting and implementing social 

accountability initiatives. The challenges that come with it along with the opportunities in 

Nepal were discussed by the respective experts in the field. 

Young Innovations took part in the panel discussion about Innovations and Social 

Accountability. Chief Executive Officer Mr. Bibhusan Bista and Chief Innovations Officer, 

Mr. Anjesh Tuladhar both were present at the discussion, the former as a moderator and 

the latter as a panelist. Experts who are involved in Innovation and social impact in Nepal 

were asked to share their experiences in the discussion. 

Young Innovations shared its story of implementing SMS based reporting system on 

National Immunization Program. The challenges related to it was discussed along with 

threats, like lack of technological advancement and language barriers in rural Nepal 

demanding additional efforts by implementing and supporting bodies for better results. 

Through the discussion, it was agreed by the panelist that innovation was undoubtedly a 

very pervasive medium today to ensure social impact and accountability. Implementing 

programs through innovative measures, however, requires additional homework on its 

feasibility since technology needs to be explained clearly, accurately and often repeatedly 

before it is understood. Training and formal education incorporating new and important 

innovations can be a good way to move forward. Including local people and organizations 

in incorporating innovations can mean better accountability from local bodies.</p>
